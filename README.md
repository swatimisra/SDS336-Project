Our socioeconomic data comes from the American Community Survey (ACS) 5-Year Estimates, 2011â€“2015 from the U.S. Census Bureau to collect tract-level socioeconomic data for all of Texas. Variables include median household income, 
poverty count, educational attainment, unemployment, and a slew of other variables we can access using ACS variable codes. 
Data was extracted using the Python censusdata package, with each tract identified by state, county, and tract FIPS codes.
The obesity-related data comes from the 500 Cities Census Tract-level Data (GIS Friendly Format), 2018 release, provided by the CDC. 
This dataset includes tract-level measures such as obesity prevalence, high blood pressure, and cholesterol.
